# ColorsTable

This project manage colors in a table. You can add new colors to table, delete color and update.

I created a database of colors and update all changes from table.

My project is built in vb.net. I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to create my database. The client side is written with jquery library, javascript, html and css.
